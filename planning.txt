This is used for planning the application out.

Pages
- I will have 3 pages: home, shop, and cart (which will have icon and # of elements)
- Home page will just be some text and images about the shop; maybe include some items as well
- Shop page will be a grid of items (flexible using css grid); can adjust number of items and add to cart
- cart will also be able to adjust number of items as well as remove. also have button to checkout (will have no functionality for purpose of this project)

Components
- Components folder
  - Nav bar folder
    - nav.jsx : has home, shop, and checkout with num of items (planning to do show num of items as every single item, even if multiple of same item)
  - Home page folder
    - home.jsx
  - Shop page folder
    - shop.jsx
    - itemcard.jsx
  - cart folder
    - cart.jsx
    - maybe do component for each item shown in cart
  - maybe do component for the input and the incrementing (can use in shop page for each item as well as cart page for each item)
- app.jsx
  - have state for cart (pass this into cart, pass setCart into shop)
  - also handle the effect for fetching products (only on mount)
  - pass products into shop, pass cart into cart



Styling
- I will be using CSS-in-JS
